#  MNIST Classification with Neural Networks: Comparative Analysis of Architectures
This project aims to explore the effectiveness of various neural network architectures in classifying the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms. In this project, we implement four different architectures, each varying in the number of hidden layers, inclusion of dropout layers, and utilization of regularization techniques.
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
* Implementing four distinct neural network architectures for MNIST classification.
* Experimenting with different configurations of hidden layers, dropouts, and regularization methods within each architecture.
* Training and evaluating each architecture on the MNIST dataset.
* Comparing the performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, of the four architectures.
* Identifying the most effective architecture based on the comparative analysis.
